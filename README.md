# Northcoders News API

## Hosted Version

Here is a link to the hosted version of the application: [NC News API](https://be-nc-news-project-j8hl.onrender.com/api)

## Local Setup

There are two .env files that will need to be created in the root directory in order to run this project locally. A `.env.test` file and a `.env.development` file.

They each need to be inserted with a `PGDATABASE=` key with their respective database name.


They should look something like this:

#### .env.test

`PGDATABASE=nc_news_test`

#### .env.development 

`PGDATABASE=nc_news`
