# Northcoders News API

## Local Setup

There are two .env files that will need to be created in the root directory in order to run this project locally. A '.env.test' file and a '.env.development' file.

They each need to be inserted with a 'PGDATABASE=' key with their respective database name.

They should look something like this:

### .env.test

'PGDATABASE=nc_news_test'

### .env.development 

'PGDATABASE=nc_news'
